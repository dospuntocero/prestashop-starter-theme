# Prestashop Starter Theme

Just a blank Prestashop theme. Nothing special, nothing added. These are the original files from the default theme, without all the basic style and annoying useless stuff hidden here and there. I like to start from scratch when working on a new theme so there is now Twitter Bootstrap, no normalize.css or anything like that included.

It's not supposed to be something interesting to share, putting this on Github is just a way for me to know where it is when I need it instead of losing it in the deep entrails of my computer.
